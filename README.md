# SharpKit.ExtendedClr
This repository contains rewritten runtime for JsClr mode and BCL. It works best with [SharpKit.UnobtrusiveFeatures](https://github.com/maraf/SharpKit.UnobtrusiveFeatures), because the plugin adds contructor and other features that are supported in this runtime. Beside these features it also adds some missing or wrong named methods and types from the original JsClr.
